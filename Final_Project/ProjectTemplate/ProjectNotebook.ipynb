    "Hi this is a different version of blackjack. I like blackjack as a card game, so I wanted to do something similar to that. The premise of the game is the same as regular blackjack where the player gets handed 2 random cards and those 2 cards get added together. Normally there is both a dealer and player, but in my version there is only a player rather than deciding who wins based on eachother, the player wins if they're cards add up to be between 17 and 21. If they go over they bust, and if their total is under and they decide not to hit then they lose. Another thing that I added to the game is how many hits it took you to win. In this game, the more hits the better. Another part of the game is the probability part. If you have already hit and are still under 17, it will show you the probability of winning with the next card. Have fun!"

    "This is my first coding class as I have bever even done anything remotely close to coding. I am what som emight call computer illiterate, the most I do on a computer is write on google docs, check emails, and watch videos. It was interesting to see the makings behind those things though. I did have some help in making some of the functions. Something the I really had some trouble with was particularly the formatting of all the loops as well as the play_again function and how to better format that into it.  "
